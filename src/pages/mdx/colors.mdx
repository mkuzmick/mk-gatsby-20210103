# COLOR PICKER TESTS

let's see some things you can do with the [react-color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) package.

just

```
npm i react-color
```

and then

<PhotoshopPicker />

did that work?

do changes show here?

what about additional components?

<SketchPicker />

that should be a SketchPicker.

<ColorPicker /> 

is that better?
